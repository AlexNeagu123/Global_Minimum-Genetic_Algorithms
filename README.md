# Global_Minimum-Genetic_Algorithms
The main goal of this experiment is to compute the global minimum value of several multidimensional benchmark functions.

Consult **Paper.pdf** to see the contents of the experiment.

This paper describes a **Genetic Algorithm** with several optimizations including **Meta-Algorithms**, **Gray Codes** and **Adaptive Parameters**.
